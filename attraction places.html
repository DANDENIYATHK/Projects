<tr><td><p align="justify"><font color="#000000" font size="5"><b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mangrove forest is the local name (Kirala Kele) denotes; this magnificent wetland covers 1800 hectares and is located in southern Sri Lanka off Matara. It is comprised of marshlands, irrigation channels, and mangrove habitats. Mangrove distribution in Sri Lanka about 0.34% of the total land area or 6000 – 7000 ha is a very important ecosystem which provides a wide array of benefits to humans as well as for the balance of nature.

There are many mangrove species recorded here out of 29 mangrove species available in the country. Like in most of the mangrove habitats, high genetic, species and Eco-system diversity is recorded in the area.

The Nilwala Flood Protection works and expanding agriculture have changed the ecology of the forest. A network recently repaired of irrigation canals has restored the water flow in the mangrove area.

Today this wetland is considered to be one of the most valuable conservation areas in Southern Sri Lanka with an ideal habitat for wetland biodiversity. Being close to Matara town, it is a potential site for nature-based tourism.

The presence of fossils of the Windowpane oysters (Placenta placenta) in the area indicates that the area has been subjected to inundation by seawater during the Pleistocene period (3 million to 10,000 years before the present).

Apart from being a very valuable contributor to the natural wealth of the country, Kirala kele supports about 35,000 people in the surrounding area. It provides a wide array of benefits to the people in the region; it is being used for raising cattle and fishing.

Freshwater fishes form an important part of the wetland and provide food for the communities. Small-scale fishing is very common to supplement household income.

This complex, rich wetland habitat is the home for many animals. Thirteen species of mammals have been recorded from the site, including the common and endemic Purple-faced leaf monkey (Trachypithecus vetulus), and the Toque macaque (Macaca sinica).

Wetland birds are the most prominent animals of Kirala kelle. One hundred and three bird species were recorded from Kirala kele, of which 48 are wetland birds.

Large flocks of Lesser whistling ducks (Dendrocygna javanica) are a common sight; Other common birds include the Asian Openbill (Anastomus oscitans), Purple Swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio), Purple heron (Ardea purpurea), Pheasant-tailed Jacana (Hydrophasianus chirurgus), and Pond heron (Ardeola grayii). Kirala kelle not only provides the feeding ground for many bird species but also provides nesting habitats for many bird species such as herons, cormorants, egrets, coots, weavers and Munias. An influx of migratory wetland birds can also be observed during the migratory season from early September to late March every year.

About 25 species of fish are found in the waters of the wetland. The exotic species, Tilapia (Oreochromis mosambicus) and Niloti (Oreochromis niloticus) are the most abundant. Other commercially important fish are the Murrel (Channa striata), spotted snakehead (Channa punctata), stinging catfish (Heteropneustes fossils) and walking catfish (Clarias brachysoma).

In addition to the above, many species of butterflies, reptiles, and amphibians there are hundreds of invertebrate species that also decorate the biological wealth of Kirala Kelle.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliyagane forest is situated between Akuressa and Kamurupitiya gramaseva divisions in the district of Matara. Even though this unpopular forest is small in size (482.9 ha), it can be considered one of the most picturesque forest covers in southern Sri Lanka.

The forest serves as a valuable catchment area in the southern part of the country. In 1993 it was decided to declare the forest a protected area and several years earlier it was declared a biosphere reserve due to its contribution to the environment.

The soil in the forest mainly consists of Red and Yellow Solid soils while the areas with water resources are dominated by alluvial soil. Being a forest in the wet zone of Sri Lanka, it is soaked up mainly during the South-West monsoon, from April to November and yearly rainfall is recorded as 2465 mm. due to the heavy rainfall and other characteristics, the forest is categorized under the wet evergreen rain forest.

There are two valuable medium size natural lakes that can be seen in the forest, one is situated toward the western part of the forest and the second lake is called Hali Ela, located towards the North-East end of the forest.

Hali Ela is bigger in size than the other lake and it can store a large amount of water compared to the smaller tank. Hali Ela is mainly fed by a few small streams and rainwater. Both tanks show a sizable concentration of water throughout the year and the tanks are fed by the Oligane forest during the drought period.

Oliyagane forest harbours a large number of flora species, that are particularly important for the country. More than half (58%) of trees and plants in the forest are endemic to the island.

Bedi del, An Kenda, Beru, Weli Piyanna, Pat Kela, Doba, Keena, Kudumiriya, Kalu Mediriya, Hora, Bu Hora, Beraliya, Dun, Ini Petta, Nitiya Dun, Godapara, Atama, Wildwood apple, Goraka, Veera, Milla, Keena, Katu Kenda are some of the most seen trees and plants of the forest. The forest is inhabited by several species of animals such as Wild boar, Porcupine, black monkey, several species of mouse, and squirrel.

The forest attracts a number of resident bird species, due to the abundance of water in the area. Little Cormorant (Microcarbo niger), Sri Lanka Grey Hornbill (Ocyceros gingalensis), Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea), Lesser Adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres) and Black-crested Bulbul (Pycnonotus melanicterus) are some of the most common bird species in the forest.

The forest reserve is resided by five species of butterflies and the lakes harbour a large number of fish species. One species called Dankola Petiya is only seen in the Oliyagane forest reserve.

The leading amphibian species of the forest is the frog and the number of reptile species is also recorded in the forest reserve.  Cobra (Naja naja), CommonKraitt (Bungarus caeruleus), Sri Lanka Krait (Bungarus ceylonicus), Russells’s viper (Daboia russelii), Saw scale viper (Echis carinatus) are some of the most seen reptiles in the reserve.

Most of the trees and plants of the forest are considered relatively new due to the removal of initial forest cover (deforestation). Today it has become a fully grown secondary rainforest under forest regeneration and the property is protected under the wildlife act of Sri Lanka.
